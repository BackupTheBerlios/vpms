(config) - display current configuration
(config (('N 1000) (B 1.3))) - sets two parameters in configuration leaving the rest.
(create-environment n) - create environment with "n" individuals 
(do-step n) - do "n" simulation steps (n - optional, default 1)
(optimize-environment) - clear genomes with no individuals attached (speeds up simulation a lot)

(get-state) - get current state: number of indiviuals, killed individuals
              (by mutations and Verhulst factor) and born individuals.
(get-population) - get population structure
(get-mortality) - get population mortality
(get-time) - get time of simulation (time step)
(get-genome-ranking n) - displays ranking of "n" most represented genomes (n=8 by default)

(logging b) - turn on/off logging (#t/#f)
(warranty) - display warranty


Examples:
(print-list (get-mortality))
